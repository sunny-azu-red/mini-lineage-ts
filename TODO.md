# 🛠️ TODO List

- put the battle story strings in data
- make it so that you cant buy armor or weapon if you already have the exact one, the option should be disabled in the list
- can we animate the health bar and xp bar? perhaps save the previous hp or xp in session and when you refresh the page, show the previous hp and xp but then animate to the actual hp and xp
- and on that note maybe the bar labels should be animated too?
- generate even more text versions for the battleground
- i dont like the *.view.ts files, that logic can maybe go in the controller and the controller should render the .ejs files directly
- dry the code and ask for improvements
